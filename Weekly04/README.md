# Week 04 Goals
---

1. Port weeks 1-3 games to Android using flixel touch input or [GamePad-haxe](https://github.com/AdamHarte/Gamepad-Haxe)
2. Post on my [tumblr](http://maskedpixelgames.com) about the games and your project and goals.
3. Evaluate the code and look for areas of duplication so that you can start building a 'personal' library.
