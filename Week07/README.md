# Week 07 - Match 'em

## Description

Music thumps as you try and match as many horizontal lines of three as you can before the blocks reach the top.

### Details
Game Board is 8x10???

3 colors?

A 'metronome' moves from the bottom to the top.
*  The metronome 'matches' 3 horizontal blocks.
*  Rows of 3 or more can chain with blocks directly above them as the metronome hits them.
*  When it reaches the top, a new row of blocks falls.

Make rows by swapping adjacent blocks.

Game over when a row of blocks breaks the top of the board.
